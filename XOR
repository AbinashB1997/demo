You r given 2 numbers(N and X)
Create an array of N natural nums such that the XOR of these nums = X
The sum of all the nums that are available in the array is as min as possible.
If there exist multiple arrays, print the one which is smallest among them.

Array 'A' is less than Array 'B' if for any idx 'i', A[i] < B[i] and for all
indices that are less than i, A[i] == B[i]

Sample inp:
3 2
Sample Out:
1 1 2

Explanation: 

We have to print 3 natural numbers having the minimum sum, such that their 
XOR is 2 & print them in the increasing order. Thus N spaced nums are [1, 1, 2]
