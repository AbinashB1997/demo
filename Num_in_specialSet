Given 3 integers A, B, and C. 

A special set contains the nums that are multiples of any of these 3 integers 
in sorted order.(Because elements residing in set are usually in sorted order) 

A Kth num is available in a special set. Your task is to determine that Kth 
numof the special set.


Sample inp:
TestCase = 2
1 2 3 4
2 4 5 5 

Sample out:
4
8

Explanation:
for TC-1:
Special set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . . . }
Hence, 4th num = 4.

for TC-2:
Special set = {2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, . . . . }
Hence, 5th num = 8
